Early to bed and early to rise makes us healthy, wealthy and wise
It is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.
No kid is unsmart. Every kid's a genius at something. Our job is to find it. And then encourage it.
Pulling someone down will never help you reach the top.
All your dreams can come true if you have the courage to pursue them
Give the world the best you have, and the best will come to you
Do not give up, the beginning is always the hardest
If you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely
